# Password_Generator

Full detailed example of Javascript's ability to create passwords in a web browser

This project displays javascripts ability to employ user input in the form of a random password generator.

The code allows for the user to set a character length for their password, choose a minimum of 1 option for what conditions they want included in their password, and if they dont meet these conditions, the user is alerted that they must choose at least one condition for their password. 

This project was very informative in the way that javascript functions and communicates amongst itself. It also was very good practice for incorporating user input in a web page and was by far the most important aspect of the project for me.

Thank you
